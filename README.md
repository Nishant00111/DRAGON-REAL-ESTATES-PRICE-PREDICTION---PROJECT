# DRAGON-REAL-ESTATES-PRICE-PREDICTION---PROJECT

## Welcome to the Dragon Real Estates Price Prediction project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Dragon Real Estates dataset using Python and various machine learning libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict property prices based on different features.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Dragon Real Estates dataset, which consists of various features such as property size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant attributes. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using the power of Python and data manipulation libraries, we perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Key aspects of the analysis include:

#### Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming features as needed.
#### Descriptive statistics: Summarizing the dataset, calculating mean, median, and other statistical measures.
#### Data visualization: Creating meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (property price).
### Machine Learning Models
After completing the EDA, we move on to developing machine learning models to predict property prices. In this project, we have implemented three models:

**Decision Tree:** We trained a decision tree model to make predictions based on the provided features. Decision trees are known for their ability to capture complex relationships in data.

**Linear Regression:** We also utilized linear regression, a widely-used algorithm for predicting continuous values. This model aims to find the best linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

**Random Forest Regression:** To further improve the prediction accuracy, we implemented a random forest regression model. Random forests combine multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.

### Model Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score. The evaluation results provide insights into the effectiveness of each model in predicting property prices.

### Model Outputs
During the evaluation of our machine learning models, we considered the issue of overfitting and underfitting. To address this, we employed cross-validation, a technique that helps assess the models' generalization performance. The following are the mean and standard deviation of the evaluation metrics obtained for each model:

**Decision Tree:**
Mean: 4.072333171164347
Standard Deviation: 0.586244335651366

**Linear Regression:**
Mean: 5.037482786117751
Standard Deviation: 1.059438240560695

**RandomForestRegressor (Best Model):**
Mean: 3.395756795037741
Standard Deviation: 0.8014805110704429

**From the evaluation results**, it is evident that the RandomForestRegressor model outperformed the other models. It achieved the lowest mean prediction error and exhibited a relatively lower standard deviation, indicating better consistency in its performance. The RandomForestRegressor model demonstrated its ability to capture complex relationships in the dataset and provide more accurate property price predictions.

Based on these findings, we can conclude that the RandomForestRegressor model is the most suitable and effective for predicting property prices in the Dragon Real Estates dataset.

### Conclusion
The Dragon Real Estates Price Prediction project showcases the power of Python and machine learning in analyzing real estate data and predicting property prices. By utilizing libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, we have gained valuable insights into the dataset, developed models, evaluated their performance, and mitigated overfitting and underfitting issues using cross-validation.

The RandomForestRegressor model emerged as the best performer, providing the most accurate property price predictions. We believe that this project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in real estate analysis and prediction. Your feedback and suggestions for further improvements are highly appreciated.
